# tl;dr

What are orbifolds

quotient of space by action of a finite group

# History

first hypothesis in topology
satake -V maniflds
Macbeath
William thurston "cannot be blamed"
Conway ("thurstons greatest prophet")
Grigori clay math award / millenium

# Connection to Symmetry

Dividing space - discrete object vs. periodic space - develop intuition

First few chapters of Conway's book
Dunbar's paper
Conways other papers

# Proof of 17 Wallpaper Groups

"Top down" approach (Surgery on a sphere) connects to "bottom up" (folding FD)
Gauss Bonnet theorem

topologies (p1=torus, p2=pillowcase, p3-p6=turnover)

# Topologically Distinct Domains

Different cuttings to produce different isohedral tiles (some of them are FD)
Point to papers coming out?

For most applications, it doesn't matter how you select the tile - you can cut the same crystal many ways --> "headless horse" situation
See ETH zurich java applet for example where you use a single tile
ITCA uses a single tile

# Generating Crystals

PACCS - have separate post about paper on this
Wykoff positions and stoichiometry (a bit about this)
High symmetry hypothesis from David Wales

# Beyond

So far, have focused discussion on 2D Euclidean space but is extensible to 3D and to non-Euclidean spaces (Hyde paper and Conway's book).
As already discussed, this is connected to tiling theories. <a href="#conway">[1]</a>

2D Crystallographic Tiling

Heesch Tiles - 28 tiles from certain wallpaper groups

# Fundamental Domains from Orbifolds

Conway's symbols on circles - "shortcut" method to get FD for groups

# Fundamental Domain Tilings

Can find all 46 FDs for groups by making transformations in the plane.

# Non-FD Tilings

The other 47 "molecular" units.
